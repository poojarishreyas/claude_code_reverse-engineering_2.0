# File-finding evaluation

Measures how well the agent finds and fixes the right code before any navigation feature (symbol tools, a code graph, co-change ranking) is built. A feature ships only if it moves these numbers.

## How a task is made

Tasks come from a repository's own bug-fix history. A commit qualifies when its subject reads like a fix (or it adds a `bug-fix` Agent Note), it changes 1–3 package or app source files, it changes at least one `tests/**/*.spec.ts` file, and it touches at most 12 files. Tasks that only change locale files are skipped, because a copy edit says little about file-finding.

For each task the runner:

1. checks out the fix commit in a detached git worktree and restores the source files to the parent commit, keeping the fix's tests;
2. installs dependencies and runs those tests, and drops the task if they already pass;
3. gives the agent the failing test output as its only instruction — the source files and the commit subject are not revealed;
4. runs the agent headless through the shipped base profile (`packages/test-support/loader-smoke/tests/fixtures/base-driver.ts` with [`eval.cordis.yml`](eval.cordis.yml));
5. re-runs the tests and computes metrics from the streamed session events.

## Difficulty

Each task is tagged by what makes its file hard to find from the failing test:

| Tag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `cross-package` | A fix file lives in a different package or app than every failing test |
| `indirect` | No failing test imports a fix file, so the agent must trace the call path |
| `multi-file` | The fix spans more than one source file, and all must be found |
| `direct` | None of the above: the test imports the fix file in its own package (the control case) |

`--hard` runs only tagged tasks, taking `cross-package`, `indirect`, and `multi-file` in turn so each kind is represented. Tags appear in the log, each `<task>.json`, and `summary.md`.

## Metrics

| Metric | Meaning |
|---|---|
| passed | The fix's tests pass afterwards and no test file was edited |
| right file edited | At least one of the real fix's source files was edited |
| first seen step | First step whose search results or reads named a real fix file |
| first read step | First step that read a real fix file |
| reads before correct | `read` calls before that first correct read |
| steps, tool calls | Model responses and tool calls the run took |
| prompt tokens | Every input token sent, cached or not, so agents with different caching compare fairly |
| extra edits | Files edited that are neither fix sources nor tests |

`summary.json` aggregates pass count, correct-file count, and medians; `summary.md` is a per-task table; `<task>.json` holds each run's full metrics and final answer.

## Running it

```sh
# Prepare and validate tasks only; no model key needed.
pnpm run eval:file-finding -- --repo <path-to-repo> --limit 5 --dry-run

# Full run; needs DEEPSEEK_API_KEY (model via DSH_EVAL_PROVIDER / DSH_EVAL_MODEL).
pnpm run eval:file-finding -- --repo <path-to-repo> --limit 20 --out eval-results

# Edge cases only: tasks where the failing test does not lead straight to the fix.
pnpm run eval:file-finding -- --repo <path-to-repo> --hard --limit 6

# A model from an existing DSH home (e.g. a custom provider), and specific tasks.
DSH_EVAL_PROVIDER=<provider id> DSH_EVAL_MODEL=<model id> pnpm run eval:file-finding -- --repo <path-to-repo> --home-from ~/.dsh --only <hash>,<hash>

# The same tasks worked by Claude Code (the installed `claude` CLI), for comparison.
pnpm run eval:file-finding -- --repo <path-to-repo> --hard --limit 6 --agent claude-code --claude-model sonnet
```

This repository's history is squashed, so mine a repository with real history, such as a clone of the upstream `deepseek-ai/deepseek-harness`. A blobless clone (`git clone --filter=blob:none`) is enough. `--install` overrides the dependency command, and `--keep` leaves worktrees in place for inspection.

## Comparing with Claude Code
