Available agent types for the Agent tool:
- claude: Catch-all for any task that doesn't fit a more specific agent. FleetView's default when no agent name is typed. (Tools: *)
- Explore: Fast read-only search agent for locating code. Use it to find files by pattern (eg. "src/components/**/*.tsx"), grep for symbols or keywords (eg. "API endpoints"), or answer "where is X defined / which files reference Y." Do NOT use it for code review, design-doc auditing, cross-file consistency checks, or open-ended analysis — it reads excerpts rather than whole files and will miss content past its read window. When calling, specify search breadth: "quick" for a single targeted lookup, "medium" for moderate exploration, or "very thorough" to search across multiple locations and naming conventions. (Tools: All tools except Agent, Artifact, ArtifactComments, ArtifactData, ArtifactCheck, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- general-purpose: General-purpose agent for researching complex questions, searching for code, and executing multi-step tasks. When you are searching for a keyword or file and are not confident that you will find the right match in the first few tries use this agent to perform the search for you. (Tools: *)
- Plan: Software architect agent for designing implementation plans. Use this when you need to plan the implementation strategy for a task. Returns step-by-step plans, identifies critical files, and considers architectural trade-offs. (Tools: All tools except Agent, Artifact, ArtifactComments, ArtifactData, ArtifactCheck, ExitPlanMode, Edit, Write, NotebookEdit)
- statusline-setup: Use this agent to configure the user's Claude Code status line setting. (Tools: Read, Edit)

The following skills are available for use with the Skill tool:

- dataviz: Use this skill whenever you are about to create ANY chart, graph, plot, dashboard, or data visualization, in ANY output medium — an HTML or React artifact, inline SVG, plotting code in any library (matplotlib, plotly, d3, Recharts, …), an image/PNG you will render and upload, or a chart shared into Slack. Read it BEFORE writing the first line of chart code, choosing chart colors, building a stat tile / meter / KPI row, or laying out a dashboard. When the destination is a first-party document connector (host-designated, never self-described) that renders live charts, hand it the rows (inline, or as an uploaded data file the chart cites) rather than a rendered PNG/SVG — a picture of a chart loses hover, data inspection and per-value comments. Produces visualizations that read as one system — elegant, accessible, consistent in light and dark — using a brand-neutral placeholder palette you swap for your own. Teaches a design-system-agnostic method: a form heuristic, a color formula with a runnable validator, mark specs, and interaction rules. A validated default palette is documented in `references/palette.md` — swap that file's values for your brand's. Triggers on: "chart", "graph", "plot", "data viz", "visualization", "dashboard", "analytics", "visualize data", "categorical colors", "sequential / diverging palette", "stat tile", "sparkline", "heatmap", "legend", "axis", "tooltip", "chart colors", "color by series".
- update-config: Use this skill to configure the Claude Code harness via settings.json. Automated behaviors ("from now on when X", "each time X", "whenever X", "before/after X") require hooks configured in settings.json - the harness executes these, not Claude, so memory/preferences cannot fulfill them. Also use for: permissions ("allow X", "add permission", "move permission to"), env vars ("set X=Y"), hook troubleshooting, or any changes to settings.json/settings.local.json files. Examples: "allow npm commands", "add bq permission to global settings", "move permission to user settings", "set DEBUG=true", "when claude stops show X". For simple settings like theme/model, suggest the /config command.
- keybindings-help: Use when the user wants to customize keyboard shortcuts, rebind keys, add chord bindings, or modify ~/.claude/keybindings.json. Examples: "rebind ctrl+s", "add a chord shortcut", "change the submit key", "customize keybindings".
- code-review: Review the current diff, or a PR number/branch/path target, for correctness bugs (plus reuse/simplification/efficiency cleanups where the model's review recipe covers them) at the given effort level (low/medium: fewer, high-confidence findings; high→max: broader coverage, may include uncertain findings; ultra: deep multi-agent review in the cloud (requires claude.ai account access)); with no level given, it reuses the level you typed last. Pass --comment to post findings as inline PR comments, or --fix to apply the findings to the working tree after the review. For ultra on a GitHub.com PR target, --post asks to post the finished review’s findings to the PR as a single comment from the user’s GitHub account (not a review; the launch dialog still confirms in interactive sessions, while non-interactive mode posts on the flag alone) and --no-post hides that option.
- simplify: Review the changed code for reuse, simplification, efficiency, and altitude cleanups, then apply the fixes. Quality only — it does not hunt for bugs; use /code-review for that.
- fewer-permission-prompts: Scan your transcripts for common read-only Bash and MCP tool calls, then add a prioritized allowlist to project .claude/settings.json to reduce permission prompts.
- loop: Run a prompt or slash command on a recurring interval (e.g. /loop 5m /foo). Omit the interval to let the model self-pace. - When the user wants to set up a recurring task, poll for status, or run something repeatedly on an interval (

The user wants me to:
1. Use Grep to find 'x ='
2. Read a.ts
3. Edit a.ts to set x to 2
4. Reply done

Let me start by using Grep to find 'x ='.
```

</details>

I'll search for 'x =', read a.ts, and make the edit.
